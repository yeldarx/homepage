Salem!

I'm Yeldar Kudaibergenov, a podcaster and aspiring programmer from Astana, Kazakhstan.

As someone who has authored numerous podcasts, I have gained extensive experience in the field of audio storytelling. However, I've ventured into the realm of programming to acquire the skills necessary for developing innovative solutions.

My ultimate objective is to develop projects that address real-world issues, with a strong focus on creating solutions that contribute to the broader goals of accessibility, inclusion, and sustainability.

Join me on this exciting journey to explore the dynamic intersection of technology and content creation.
